# üêá Rabbit MQ Elixir

The missing RabbitMQ client for Elixir.

## Why use `rabbit_mq_ex`

* Built-in topology configuration
* Built-in 0 configuration Producer and Consumer workers (pooling)
* API-design 
* Sensible defaults

... as opposed to `amqp`?   

* `amqp` is a relatively low level implementation

## Core concepts and architecture

* Each Producer module is implicitly converted into a pool of supervised producer workers with round-robin dispatch
* Each Producer module implicitly creates and supervises its own connection
* Each Consumer module is is implicitly converted into a group of supervised consumer workers
* Each Consumer module implicitly creates and supervises its own connection
* There are sensible defaults
* There are imposed requirements
* There is a application-scoped limit of channels per connection
