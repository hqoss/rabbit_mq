# üêá Elixir RabbitMQ Client

`rabbit_mq` is an opinionated RabbitMQ client to help _you_ build balanced and consistent Consumers and Producers.

## Installation and Usage

Add `:rabbit_mq` as a dependency to your project's `mix.exs`:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:rabbit_mq, "~> 0.0.0-alpha-8"}
  ]
end
```

## Documentation

The full documentation is [published on hex](https://hexdocs.pm/rabbit_mq/).

The following modules are provided;

-   [`RabbitMQ.Topology`](https://hexdocs.pm/rabbit_mq/RabbitMQ.Topology.html)
-   [`RabbitMQ.Consumer`](https://hexdocs.pm/rabbit_mq/RabbitMQ.Consumer.html)
-   [`RabbitMQ.Producer`](https://hexdocs.pm/rabbit_mq/RabbitMQ.Producer.html)

## Sample usage

‚ö†Ô∏è The following examples assume you've already set up your (RabbitMQ) routing topology as shown below.

| source_name | source_kind | destination_name          | destination_kind | routing_key      | arguments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| customer    | exchange    | customer/customer.created | queue            | customer.created | \[]       |
| customer    | exchange    | customer/customer.updated | queue            | customer.updated | \[]       |

As seen in the RabbitMQ Management dashboard:

![RabbitMQ Topology](assets/rabbitmq-topology.png)

First, ensure you point to a valid `amqp_url` by configuring `:rabbit_mq` in your `config.exs`.

```elixir
config :rabbit_mq, :amqp_url, "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672"
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è For advanced configuration options, consult the [Configuration section](#configuration).

### Producers

Let's define our `CustomerProducer` first. We will use this module to publish messages onto the `"customer"` exchange.

```elixir
defmodule RabbitSample.CustomerProducer do
  @moduledoc """
  Publishes pre-configured events onto the "customer" exchange.
  """

  use RabbitMQ.Producer, exchange: "customer", worker_count: 3

  @doc """
  Publishes an event routed via "customer.created".
  """
  def customer_created(customer_id) when is_binary(customer_id) do
    opts = [
      content_type: "application/json",
      correlation_id: UUID.uuid4(),
      mandatory: true
    ]

    payload = Jason.encode!(%{v: "1.0.0", customer_id: customer_id})

    publish(payload, "customer.created", opts)
  end

  @doc """
  Publishes an event routed via "customer.updated".
  """
  def customer_updated(updated_customer) when is_map(updated_customer) do
    opts = [
      content_type: "application/json",
      correlation_id: UUID.uuid4(),
      mandatory: true
    ]

    payload = Jason.encode!(%{v: "1.0.0", customer_data: updated_customer})

    publish(payload, "customer.updated", opts)
  end
end
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that all Producer workers implement "reliable publishing". Each Producer worker handles its publisher confirms _asynchronously_, striking a delicate balance between performance and reliability.

To understand why this is important, please refer to the [reliable publishing implementation guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-seven-java.html).

‚ÑπÔ∏è In the unlikely event of an unexpected Publisher `nack`, your server will be notified via the `on_unexpected_nack/2` callback, letting you handle such exceptions in any way you see fit.

### Consumers

To consume messages off the respective queues, we will define 2 separate consumers.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that automatic message acknowledgement is **disabled** in `rabbit_mq`, therefore it's _your_ responsibility to ensure messages are `ack`'d or `nack`'d.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Please consult the [Consumer Acknowledgement Modes and Data Safety Considerations](https://www.rabbitmq.com/confirms.html#acknowledgement-modes) for more details.

```elixir
defmodule RabbitSample.CustomerCreatedConsumer do
  use RabbitMQ.Consumer, queue: "customer/customer.created", worker_count: 2, prefetch_count: 3

  require Logger

  def consume(payload, meta, channel) do
    Logger.info("Customer #{payload} created.")
    ack(channel, meta.delivery_tag)
  end
end
```

```elixir
defmodule RabbitSample.CustomerUpdatedConsumer do
  use RabbitMQ.Consumer, queue: "customer/customer.updated", worker_count: 2, prefetch_count: 6

  require Logger

  def consume(payload, meta, channel) do
    Logger.info("Customer updated. Data: #{payload}.")
    ack(channel, meta.delivery_tag)
  end
end
```

### Use under supervision tree

And finally, we will start our application.

‚ÑπÔ∏è To run RabbitMQ locally, see our [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) for a sample Docker Compose set up.

```elixir
defmodule RabbitSample.Application do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      RabbitSample.CustomerProducer,
      RabbitSample.CustomerCreatedConsumer,
      RabbitSample.CustomerUpdatedConsumer
    ]

    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: RabbitSample.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end
end
```

Using `iex`;

```bash
iex -S mix
```

The resulting application topology should look like this:

![Application Topology](assets/application-topology.png)

Upon closer inspection using the RabbitMQ Management dashboard, we see that:

-   a) each of our modules maintains its dedicated connection; and
-   b) each of our modules' workers maintains its dedicated channel under the respective connection.

![Connections](assets/rabbitmq-connections.png)

‚ÑπÔ∏è Detailed view of how individual workers have set up their channels. Note that the **different prefetch counts** correspond to the different configuration we provided in our Consumers, and that the Producer's 3 worker channels operate in **Confirm mode**.

![Channels](assets/rabbitmq-channels.png)

## Configuration

The following options can be configured.

```elixir
config :rabbit_mq,
  amqp_url: "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672",
  heartbeat_interval_sec: 60,
  reconnect_interval_ms: 2500,
  max_channels_per_connection: 16
```

-   `amqp_url`; **required**, the broker URL.
-   `heartbeat_interval_sec`; defines after what period of time the peer TCP connection should be considered unreachable. Defaults to `30`.
-   `reconnect_interval_ms`; the interval before another attempt to re-connect to the broker should occur. Defaults to `2500`.
-   `max_channels_per_connection`; maximum number of channels per connection. Also determines the maximum number of workers per Producer/Consumer module. Defaults to `8`.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please consult the [Channels Resource Usage](https://www.rabbitmq.com/channels.html#resource-usage) guide to understand how to best configure `:max_channels_per_connection`.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please consult the [Detecting Dead TCP Connections with Heartbeats and TCP Keepalives](https://www.rabbitmq.com/heartbeats.html) guide to understand how to best configure `:heartbeat_interval_sec`.

## Balanced performance and reliability

The RabbitMQ modules are pre-configured with sensible defaults and follow design principles that improve and delicately balance both performance _and_ reliability.

This has been possible through

-   a) extensive experience of working with Elixir and RabbitMQ in production; _and_
-   b) meticulous consultation of the below (and more) documents and guides.

‚ö†Ô∏è While most of the heavy-lifting is provided by the library itself, reading through the documents below before running _any_ application in production is thoroughly recommended.

## TODO

A quick and dirty tech-debt tracker, used in conjunction with Issues.

-   [ ] Add support for notifying the parent producer when a publisher `nack` occurs.
